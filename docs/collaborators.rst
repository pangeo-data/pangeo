Collaborators
=============

A range of funding agencies, academic institutions, companies, and individuals
contribute to Pangeo in different ways.

Funding Agencies
----------------

We are grateful to have formal funding support from several funding agencies.

Pangeo currently receives support from the NSF `EarthCube Program`_, which funds
cyberinfrastructure projects related to Earth Science. This award supports
scientists and developers at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, National
Center for Atmospheric Research, and Anaconda Inc.
The public details of the awards can be found on the NSF website:

- `LDEO Award <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1740648&HistoricalAwards=false>`_
- `NCAR Award <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1740633&HistoricalAwards=false>`_

Anaconda is funded via a subaward through Columbia.
We were awarded $1.2M over a three year period (Oct. 2017 - Sept. 2020).

The specific solicitation we responded to is
`here <https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsf.gov%2Fpubs%2F2016%2Fnsf16514%2Fnsf16514.htm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHKvXj9L4pTCnv7Ls8k6Cj5L2Iu-w>`_.
Our project is technically called an “EarthCube integration.” This type of project requires a close link to “Geoscience Use Cases,” i.e. actual science applications.
The need to closely intertwine the technical development and the scientific applications determined the structure of our proposal and the makeup of the team.

Early work on Pangeo was partly supported via the
`Alfred P. Sloan foundation <https://sloan.org/>`_, via a Sloan Research
Fellowship in Ocean Sciences awarded to Ryan Abernathey in 2016.


Institutions
------------

These institutions devote significant resources to the Pangeo project.
We are always looking to expand this list.

Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: _static/ldeo-logo.png

LDEO is a primary recipient of the :ref:`earthcube` award. Several scientists
and programmers at LDEO are active in the development of Pangeo architecture
and scientific use cases.

National Center for Atmospheric Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NCAR is a primary recipient of the :ref:`earthcube` award. NCAR scientists and
programmers are leading the deployment of Pangeo on NCAR's high-performance
computing systems and conducting scientific investigations using Pangeo tools.

Anaconda Inc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anaconda (formerly Continuum Analytics) receives support from the
:ref:`earthcube` award. Anaconda developers are contributing the the development
of xarray, dask, and the Pangeo cloud infrastucture.

UK Met Office
