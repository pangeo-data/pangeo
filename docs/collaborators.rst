Collaborators
=============

A range of funding agencies, academic institutions, companies, and individuals
contribute to Pangeo in different ways.

Funding Agencies
----------------

We are grateful to have formal funding support from several funding agencies.

Pangeo currently receives support from the US NSF `EarthCube Program`_, which
funds cyberinfrastructure projects related to Earth Science. This award supports
scientists and developers at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, National
Center for Atmospheric Research, and Anaconda Inc.
The public details of the awards can be found on the NSF website:

- `LDEO Award <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1740648&HistoricalAwards=false>`_
- `NCAR Award <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1740633&HistoricalAwards=false>`_

Anaconda is funded via a subaward through Columbia.
We were awarded $1.2M over a three year period (Oct. 2017 - Sept. 2020).

The specific solicitation we responded to is
`here <https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16514/nsf16514.htm>`_.
Our project is technically called an “EarthCube integration.” This type of project requires a close link to “Geoscience Use Cases,” i.e. actual science applications.
The need to closely intertwine the technical development and the scientific applications determined the structure of our proposal and the makeup of the team.

Pangeo receives support from the NASA `ACCESS Program`_, which funds
projects that enhance, extend, and improve existing components of NASA’s
distributed and heterogeneous data and information systems infrastructure. This
award supports scientists and engineers at the University of Washington (UW), the
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Anaconda Inc., and Element 84.
The public details of the awards will be published when NASA makes them available.
In total, we were awarded $1.5M over a two year period (Sept. 2018 - Aug. 2020).

The specific solicitation we responded to is `here <https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={7782DF97-B7AE-BDEC-A677-E96F281D39A3}&path=closedPast>`_.

The project's focus will be on the development of new data discovery tools
and processing of remote sensing datasets.
