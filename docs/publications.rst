Publications
============

It is inherently hard to track publications supported by Pangeo because
the project contributes to a wide range of software libraries, infrastructure,
and education efforts. Not all "users" of Pangeo-supported tools are even
aware of the project. This page represents our best attempt so far.

Self-Reported
-------------

We are currently relying on self-reporting to track publications. We began
collecting reports of publications on Aug. 19, 2019.

.. bibliography:: pangeo_publications.bib
   :all:
   :list: enumerated
   :style: unsrt

:download:`download pangeo_publications.bib <pangeo_publications.bib>`
