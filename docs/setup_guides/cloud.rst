Deploying Pangeo in the Cloud
=============================

Pangeo in the cloud is essentially a customized deployment of Jupyterhub.
As a starting point, we recommend reading the `Zero to Jupyterhub <https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ guide.

The Pangeo customizations are evolving rapidly.
We hope to release an up-to-date deployment guide soon.
For now, the best place to get information on deploying in the cloud is in the
GitHub repo `pangeo-data/pangeo-cloud-federation/ <https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-cloud-federation/>`_.
