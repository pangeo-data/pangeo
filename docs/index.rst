A community platform for Big Data geoscience
============================================

Our Goals
^^^^^^^^^

#. Foster collaboration around the open source scientific python ecosystem for
   ocean / atmosphere / land / climate science.
#. Support the development with domain-specific geoscience packages.
#. Improve scalability of these tools to handle petabyte-scale datasets on
   HPC and cloud platforms.

Start Here
^^^^^^^^^^

- **Science users**: read the :ref:`quickstart`, browse the :ref:`use-cases`, or
  read about the :ref:`packages`.
- **Developers / system administrators**: learn about the
  :ref:`architecture` or read the :ref:`setup-guides`.
- **General interest**: learn :ref:`about`, see the :ref:`collaborators`, or
  read the :ref:`FAQ`.
