What is Pangeo?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pangeo is first and foremost a community promoting open, reproducible, and scalable science.
This community provides documentation, develops and maintains software, and deploys
computing infrastructure to make scientific research and programming easier.
The Pangeo software ecosystem involves
open source tools such as xarray, iris, dask, jupyter, and many other packages.
There is no single software package called "pangeo"; rather, the Pangeo project serves
as a coordination point between scientists, software, and computing infrastructure.
On this website, scientists can find guides for accessing data and performing analysis
using these tools (read the :ref:`quickstart`, browse the :ref:`use-cases`, and
learn about the :ref:`packages`).
Those interested in building infrastructure can find
instructions for deploying Pangeo environments on HPC or cloud clusters
(learn about the :ref:`architecture` or read the :ref:`setup-guides`).
For more general information, read :ref:`about`, see the :ref:`collaborators`,
or read the :ref:`FAQ`.
Welcome to the Pangeo community!

Our Goals
^^^^^^^^^

#. Foster collaboration around the open source scientific python ecosystem for
   ocean / atmosphere / land / climate science.
#. Support the development with domain-specific geoscience packages.
#. Improve scalability of these tools to handle petabyte-scale datasets on
   HPC and cloud platforms.
