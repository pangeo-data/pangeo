Meeting Schedule and Notes
==========================

Community Meeting
-----------------

Pangeo holds weekly community meetings every Wednesday, open to anyone who wishes to participate.
The meetings alternate between :ref:`Pangeo-Showcase` talks and informal check-ins.
The :ref:`Pangeo-Showcase` talks are 15 minutes, recorded and receive a DOI.
The check-ins are an opportunity for anyone to meet other members of the Pangeo community and let them know what
you are working on with short, one minute updates, and group discussion topics can be raised as agenda items.
Every other check-in (once every four weeks) will be held at 4pm ET to be more friendly to participants in other time zones.
