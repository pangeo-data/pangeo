Pangeo Guide for Scientists
===========================

The goal of Pangeo is to make it quicker and easier to go from raw data to
scientific insights.
We want to spend less time writing boilerplate code and be able to iterate
calculations quickly on very large datasets.
These are ambitious yet achievable long-term goals.
Reaching them will require scientists to participate in the open source process
and contribute to the development of the underlying tools.
For people coming from proprietary computing environments such as MATLAB, this
can mean changing the way you think about software and your relationship to it.

Below is a list of steps you can take to participate in the Pangeo project and
take advantage of the tools we are developing.

Learn About the Open Source Ecosystem
-------------------------------------

If you are new to open source scientific software, you might want to learn a
bit about the history and context of this community.
We recommend the following talk by `Jake VanderPlas <http://vanderplas.com/>`_
entitled *PyData 101*.

Jake's slides are `available on SpeakerDeck <https://speakerdeck.com/jakevdp/intro-to-pydata>`_.


GitHub_ has become absolutely central to the way this community works.
The Pangeo project is a GitHub-native organization.
A great general-audience introduction to the power and popularity of GitHub
can be found in the Wired article
`The GitHub Revolution: Why We're All in Open Source Now <https://www.wired.com/2013/03/github/>`_
by Mikeal Rogers.

There are lots of great free and open resources to learn how to use scientific
python.
Here is a list of a few of our favorites.

Learn About Pangeo Software
---------------------------

Pangeo is not a specific software pacakge.
A Pangeo environment is made of up of many different open-source software packages.
Each of these packages has its own repository, documentation, and development team.
You can learn more about these packages by following the links below.
This loose collection of packages is often referred to as the *Pangeo stack*.

Explore the Use Cases
---------------------

The Use Case Gallery demonstrates real-world science applications of the
Pangeo stack. The use cases are formatted as `Jupyter Notebooks`_, a
self-describing computational document including text, code, and figures.

  use_cases/index

A great for novices to learn how to use Pangeo is to start from one of these
use cases and modify it for your needs. Many of the use cases are pre-loaded
on the Pangeo deployments listed below.

Try Out a Pangeo Deployment
---------------------------

There are several places where you can access a Pangeo deployment, from which
you can analyze large datasets in a scalable, reproducible way.

If none of these meets your needs, you can create your own deployment by
following the :ref:`setup-guides`.

Give Feedback
-------------

Pangeo is a work in progress. We need engangement from scientists like you
to realize the goals of the project. Currently, the best way to provide your
feedback and interact with the Pangeo community is via the
`Pangeo GitHub issue tracker`_. We use this a forum to discuss all details
of the project. Please drop in and share what you are working on, including
any challenges your have encountered along the way.

Contribute a Use Case
---------------------

If you are using Pangeo for your research, we would love to include and example
in the Use Case Gallery.

.. note::

  The Use Case Gallery is still under construction. Check back soon for
  detailed instructions on how to contribute your use case.
  The technical implementation of the gallery is under discussion in
  `Pangeo Github issue 201 <https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo/issues/201>`_.
