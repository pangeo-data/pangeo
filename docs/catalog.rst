Pangeo Data Catalog
===================

Pangeo maintains an experimental catalog of analysis-ready cloud-based data at
`catalog.pangeo.io <https://catalog.pangeo.io/>`_.


Our project is actively researching different approaches to storing and
cataloging data in the cloud. Some important technologies currently in use
include

- `Spatiotemporal Asset Catalog <https://stacspec.org/>`_: A common language
  to describe a range of geospatial information, so it can more easily be
  indexed and discovered.
- `Intake <https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_: A python package for
  finding, investigating, loading and disseminating data.
