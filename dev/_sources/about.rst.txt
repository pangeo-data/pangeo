About Pangeo
============

Pangeo is first and foremost a :ref:`community of people <collaborators>`
working collaboratively to develop software and infrastructure to enable
Big Data geoscience research.

Some of the products produced by this community include interconnected
:ref:`software package <packages>` and :ref:`deployments <deployments>` of
this software in cloud and high-performance-computing environments. Such
a deployment is sometimes referred to as a *Pangeo Environment*.

Motivation
----------

There are several building crises facing the geoscience community:

-  *Big Data*: datasets are growing too rapidly and legacy software tools
   for scientific analysis can't handle them. This is a major obstacle
   to scientific progress.
-  *Technology Gap*: a growing gap between the technological
   sophistication of industry solutions (high) and scientific software
   (low).
-  *Reproducibility*: a fragmentation of software tools and environments
   renders most geoscience research effectively unreproducible and prone to
   failure.

Pangeo aims to address these challenges through a unified, collaborative effort.

Mission Statement
-----------------

Our mission is to cultivate an ecosystem in which the next generation of
open-source analysis tools for ocean, atmosphere and climate science can
be developed, distributed, and sustained. These tools must be scalable
in order to meet the current and future challenges of big data, and
these solutions should leverage the existing expertise outside of the
geoscience community.

Goals
-----

To accomplish this mission, we have identified three specific goals.

#. Foster collaboration around the open source scientific python ecosystem for
   ocean / atmosphere / land / climate science.
#. Support the development with domain-specific geoscience packages.
#. Improve scalability of these tools to handle petabyte-scale datasets on
   HPC and cloud platforms.

Get Involved
------------

The pangeo project is completely open to involvement from anyone with interest.
There are many ways to get involved:

- *Science users*: read the :ref:`quickstart`, browse the :ref:`use-cases`,
  read about the :ref:`packages`, or visit a :ref:`deployment <deployments>`.
- *Developers / system administrators*: learn about the
  :ref:`architecture` or read the :ref:`setup-guides`.

For more information, consult the :ref:`FAQ`.
